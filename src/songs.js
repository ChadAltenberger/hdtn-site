    I think there's still a lack of relationship,
    Cause who You are is not who I could be,
    And if I seem a little bitter then you better put my feet down, down.
    
    Cause I got my head in the clouds, head in the clouds,
    I'm in the wind, not the rain.
    I got my head in the clouds, head in the clouds,
    Just let me sing, sing again.
    
    I feel a little forced to rhyme sometimes,
    Feel a little forced to smile sometimes,
    Feel like I could never express this right,
    Like everything I sing is wrong, so why try?
    
    It just isn't like me to like me,
    And I get the feeling that You like to fight me.
    If what I'm saying here is highly unlikely,
    Then open up the door I shut, tonight, and come find me.
    
    (So runaway, take the money, and sight see,
    I get the feeling that your feelings would like me.)
    
    This opportunity just sounds like it might be,
    The perfect thing for me, cause all my Father wants to do is keep,
    Taking everything away from me.
    
    You said Your promise was peace!
    But You seem more like a fighter!
    You said Your burden was light!
    But I don't feel any lighter! (X2)
    
    I question why You never take the blame for this relationship,
    Cause who I am is not who I should be.
    
    (You seem to think a little better when you're bitter from the beat down, down.)
    
    Could somebody help me? I gotta get away now.
    Somebody tell me, if I'll ever feel alive, how
    Bitter I've become because you keep letting my mind sink down.
    
    (drown drown)
    
    God You got Your head in the clouds, head in the clouds,
    You send the wind, not the rain.
    You got Your head in the clouds, head in the clouds,
    Just let me sing, sing again.
    
    ---------
    
    I think there's still a lack in this relationship,
    Cause who I am is not the man I ever wanted to be.
    And I don't need a compliment,
    You gotta get inside my mind, cause You're the vine,
    I'm just a different limb of the poet tree.
    
    Do You remember the crash?
    Do You remember the last time we spoke?
    It was the last time I felt hope.
    But where did You go?
    I think I'm losing my smoke,
    So mirror, mirror tell me if it's all a joke.
    
    Cause buried deep inside,
    Buried in the back of my mind,
    Well, I've been trying to hide,
    And trying to lie,
    But if You got the time,
    Maybe You can try to pick apart the cynical hymns of men who stand alone in line.
    
    Just look me in the eyes.
    Tell me why do good men die?
    Open Your mouth and speak to me tonight.
    What do you mean it seems our history has seen that only He can qualify?
    Why am I so terrified to change particular cadences?
    To make some different acquaintances?
    Is this a test? Is this Your best?
    I bet You think regret with every breath.
    My chest is tightening. Your voice is frightening.
    And everything I thought I knew is wrong.
    
    You have to get outside my mind.
    I'm leaving home tonight.
    I packed my baggage and I'm heading off into the night.
    And if I don't survive, well then at least I tried.
    But this is it, so save the tears for someone else, and
    Tell the world I died.
    Tell the world I died.
    Tell the world I died.
    
    No! No! I'm afraid to let You go!
    I don't wanna die.
    But this is it, so keep Your love and tell the world that I'm alive!
    I am alive!

You're with me now.) \n \n You call me distant, \n I prefer to call it patient, \n And I can see that You're persistent, \n My God, My God, despite my inconsistencies. \n \n (You're feeling fine. \n Just come inside. \n It's time to dine. \n I brought the wine.) \n \n I'm feeling great. \n Just make the plate. \n I can't escape, I can't escape. \n \n This is a ghost town, \n So maybe we can just take a break and then turn a.... \n \n Round and round we go, \n Will it ever stop? \n Round and round we go, \n Only You can know. \n \n (DON'T LOOK BACK!) \n Yet, when we were distant, \n (THIS IS HOME!) \n That's when we became Your mission, \n (DON'T LOOK BACK!) \n And You keep giving forgiveness, \n (YOU ARE ALONE!) \n My God, my God, \n How could I forget this? \n \n ------- \n This is a great town. \n I just had to come around. \n I make my clothes from the figs and I eat with the pigs. \n This is a great town.
